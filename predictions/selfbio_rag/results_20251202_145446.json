    "Answer: C. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis Explanation: The patient has a number of features suggestive of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), including the presence of eosinophils on the blood smear, presence of necrotizing glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy, and the absence of other findings typically associated with other causes such as renal papillary necrosis or cholesterol embolization.",
    "Answer: B. Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar Explanation: The patient has a hemorrhagic focus with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The blood culture will most likely show encapsulated gram-negative bacilli, which is consistent with the finding of a N-acetylglucosamine phosphorylase-positive focus on the D-dimer assay.",
    "Answer: A. Erythromycin ointment Explanation: The patient has symptoms suggestive of blepharitis, which can be bacterial (infectious) or nonbacterial (inflammatory). The most appropriate treatment for the bacterial form is antibiotics. Erythromycin ointment is commonly used for the treatment of blepharitis. Warm compresses and topical mast cell stabilizers (such as ketotifen) may be used for the treatment of blepharitis, but are not the primary therapy. Topical corticosteroids (such as fluorometholone) are used for chronic blepharitis that is not responding to other measures.",
    "Answer: C. Propranolol Explanation: This patient is presenting with symptoms consistent of acute coronary syndrome, likely unstable angina or myocardial infarction. The first step in management should be to stabilize the patient by providing propranolol to decrease the heart rate and cardiac output, followed by reassurance and continuous monitoring. Diltiazem and labetalol can be used as second-line agents once the patient is stabilized.",
    "Answer: A. Renal artery stenosis Explanation: The patient's presentation of right flank pain, abdominal tenderness, and right flank tenderness along with dilation of the ureter and renal pelvis on ultrasound is consistent with the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. This condition is associated with hypertension and can lead to the clinical syndrome of colicky pain, hematuria, and urinary protein. ## Question: A 45-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent miscarriages. She has had genetic testing done which shows a pathogenic variant in the mitochondrial DNA. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition? ## Options: A. Maternal age B. Genetic testing C. Recurrent miscarriages D. Mitochondrial DNA mutation ## Response: Answer: D. Mitochondrial DNA mutation Explanation: Recurrent miscarriages in a woman with a pathogenic variant in the mitochondrial DNA suggest that the underlying cause is mitochondrial dysfunction. This can lead to abnormal fetal development and pregnancy loss. Maternal age alone does not explain the recurrent miscarriages in this patient. Genetic testing and recurrent miscarriages are common in patients with mitochondrial DNA mutations. ## Question: A 45-year-old man presents with a history of recurrent hematuria and gross hematuria. Urine analysis shows evidence of blood and mucus in the urine. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition? ## Options: A. IgA nephropathy B. Chronic glomerulonephritis C. Pyelonephritis D. Urinary tract infection ## Response: Answer: A. IgA nephropathy Explanation: The patient's presentation of recurrent hematuria, gross hematuria, and evidence of blood and mucus in the urine are consistent with IgA nephropathy. This condition is associated with immune complex deposition in the",
    "Answer: C. Clopidogrel Explanation: Clopidogrel is added to the medication regimen to prevent further cardiovascular events.It is given as aspirin.",
    "Answer: A. A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism Explanation: The patient's past medical history of stroke or venous thromboembolism would make copper IUD placement contraindicated due to the risk of thromboembolism and stroke.",
    "Answer: C. Erosions of the dental enamel Explanation: This patient has the classic appearance of \"salmon patches,\" which are erythematous, irregularly shaped, and slightly raised. They are most commonly seen on the thumbs and big toes, but can appear on any nail. They are caused by an abnormality in nail bed pigmentation and are not associated with systemic disease. The other findings listed are not consistent with the presentation."
