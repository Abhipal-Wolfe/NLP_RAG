    "Answer: D. Tranexamic acid Step 1: The patient has painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration over his thighs and external genitalia. This is classic for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Step 2: TTP is a type of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) - a group of disorders characterized by microvascular thrombosis and endothelial damage. Step 3: TTP is caused by autoantibodies against ADAMTS13, a protease that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF). This leads to vWF accumulation in the microvasculature, causing microvascular thrombosis and endothelial damage. Step 4: TTP is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. Step 5: Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine analog that inhibits fibrinolysis by binding to plasminogen and preventing its activation into plasmin. This prevents the breakdown of fibrin, which helps to stabilize the microvascular thrombi and reduce endothelial damage. Step 6: Tranexamic acid is the most effective treatment for TTP and has been shown to improve survival rates. Step 7: Hyperbaric oxygen is not effective for TTP and is not recommended for treatment. Step 8: Protein C concentrate is not effective for TTP and is not recommended for treatment. Step 9: Argatroban is an anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin, but it is not effective for TTP and is not recommended for treatment. Step 10: Tranexamic acid is the most effective",

This can cause a variety of symptoms, including finger pain, nausea, and confusion. Step 3: Hypocalcemia is a condition in which the blood calcium level is below normal. This can occur due to a variety of factors, including low dietary intake of calcium, vitamin D deficiency, and certain medical conditions such as hyperparathyroidism.",

    "Answer: A. Upregulated expression of exogenously synthesized antigens Step 1: The patient has anorexia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, and dark-colored urine - these are classic symptoms of hepatitis A.

Step 7: T cells recognize antigens presented by MHC class I molecules - this is the basis of the adaptive immune response. Step 8: Increased expression of MHC class I molecules on infected cells is primarily induced by a molecule that is also responsible for upregulated expression of exogenously synthesized antigens - this is the key step. ## Question: A 25-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of fever, chills, and a productive cough.
