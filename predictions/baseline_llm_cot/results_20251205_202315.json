A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error. # Now answer the following question. ## Question: Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 12-week exercise intervention on the cardiovascular risk profile of sedentary adults with type 2 diabetes. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 120 sedentary adults with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a 12-week exercise intervention or a control group. The exercise intervention consisted of 3 sessions per week of aerobic exercise (walking, cycling, or treadmill) for 30 to 45 minutes at 60 to 70% of the heart rate reserve. The control group received no exercise intervention. The primary outcome was the change in the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in the FRS at 24 weeks, changes in the FRS at 12 weeks in relation to changes in body mass index (BMI), and changes in the FRS at 12 weeks in relation to changes in waist circumference. Results: The mean FRS at baseline was 10.2% (SD, 10.2%) in the exercise group and 10.3% (SD, 10.2%) in the control group. The mean FRS at 12 weeks was 10.0% (SD, 10.2%) in the exercise group and 10.3% (SD, 10.2%) in the control group. The mean FRS at 24 weeks was 10.0% (SD,",
